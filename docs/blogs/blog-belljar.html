        <p>We kicked off our book club with <i>The Bell Jar</i> by Sylvia Plath! We heard this book was a lot, so we were a little scared to read it, but it's too much of a literary classic to pass up.</p>

        <p>We met again at Hamza's apartment. I didn't read the assigned chapters cuz I only had time to read 5 chapters :(, but we were able to discuss nonetheless! I remember we talked about how Esther lived in NYC just like us! I was super impressed by how she mentioned that she walked 40 blocks with ease!</p>

        <p>We finished the book yay!!! I brought some non-alcoholic wine to celebrate! I really enjoyed the book and liked Esther's story. Plath is a genius and the metaphor about the fig tree shook me to my core. Next we're going to write essays, I can't wait!!</p>
